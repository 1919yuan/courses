Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) for solving optimization problems with
non-linear constraints.

Author: Lin Yuan (bourne dot yuan at gmail dot com)

This is a by-product of one of my course projects. 
(http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~yuanl/download/CS590OPT/report.pdf)

The code uses the liblbfgs library as a subroutine, and try to setup
the alm procedure interfaces in a similar manner to liblbfgs.
(http://www.chokkan.org/software/liblbfgs/).

Please see "example" directory for usages, pretty similar to liblbfgs.
To compile the example, run (requires CMake)

$ cd example
$ ./test.sh
